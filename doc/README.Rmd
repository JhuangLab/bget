# bget

Lightweight downloader for bioinformatics data, databases and files. Golang `http` library, `wget`, `curl`, `axel`, `git`, and `rsync` were supported as the download engine.

Possible URLs pool:

- Reference genomes
- Source code of bioinformatics tools
- Bioinformatics databases and files
- Papers material
- ......

Why we want to create this tool? 

We can query PDF of the manuscript via using Endnote or sci-hub. However, you can not easily get the supplementary files of scientific papers based on the two ways.

![doi demo](https://github.com/openbiox/bget/raw/master/doc/static/doi.gif)

Here, we are developing and sharing an open-source tool bget with `doi` subcommand to query supplementary files of scientific papers. The journals with high impact factors or those integrative publishers are a higher priority in our development plan: https://github.com/openbiox/bget/blob/master/doc/doi.md

It is noted that we do not want to distribute any pirated resources or cause unnecessary network congestion.
We hope this tool can provide an optional method to more easily query related files of scientific papers. Please use it in a non-invasive way (i.e. high concurrency, long continuous request).

## Prerequisities

- Headless Chrome is required for some of website with JavaScript driven render pages.

Install Chrome on Linux:

- [How to Install Google Chrome Web Browser on Ubuntu](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-google-chrome-web-browser-on-ubuntu-18-04/)
- [How to Install Google Chrome Web Browser on CentOS](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-google-chrome-web-browser-on-centos-7/)

For windows users, you may need to create an alias of Chrome to make [chromedp](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp) work.

## Installation

```bash
# download bget on MAC OSX
wget -c https://github.com/openbiox/bget/releases/download/v0.1.3/bget_osx
mv bget_osx bget
chmod a+x bget
#
# download bget on Linux
wget -c https://github.com/openbiox/bget/releases/download/v0.1.3/bget_linux64
mv bget_linux64 bget
chmod a+x bget
#
# download bget on Windows
wget -c https://github.com/openbiox/bget/releases/download/v0.1.3/bget.exe
#
# get latest version
go get -u github.com/openbiox/bget
```

## Usage

Demo Video: <https://www.notion.so/sjtu/Demo-of-bget-doi-key-seq-url-78c2c334bf894668aa17fd128bd3255c>

```{bash}
bget -h

```

### bget doi

The `bget doi` supported website and journals are continuely increasing.

**Warn**: If you do not follow the policies of the relevant website (i.e. continuous download or limited copyright), you will lose the authorization to use this tool.

```{bash}
bget doi -h

```

### bget key

`bget key` can be used to download a set of files via a alias name key.

```{bash}
bget key -h

```

```{bash}
## show all supported items
bget key -a
```

### bget seq

`bget seq` can be used to access [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/), and [GDC Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) are supported.

```{bash}
bget seq -h

```

### bget url

`bget url` can be used to access files via input URLs. Golang http, wget, curl, axel and git, and rsync are support for download process. 

```{bash}
bget url -h
```
